        * I can use comparison operators and arithmetic operators and understand operator precedence (order of operations).
 
 * Goal 8
    * *Knowledge*
        * I can use sequence, selection, and repetition control structures to write programs that accept user input, perform processing tasks, and produce output, with user-friendly interfaces.
 
 ## Learning Goals - Software Development

        * I can write human-readable programs (naming, indenting) with appropriate documentation (comments).
 
 * Goal 9

 ### Question 1
 
 You've noticed that your parents seem attached to watching weather reports on the television for some reason, rather than just checking the Weater app on their phone.
 
 You've also noticed that the weather reporter's comments are very predictable.
 
 A variable `temperature` has been created below with a value of 0.

 Write an if statement that prints "Brr, grab your winter jacket!" when the temperature is equal to 0.
 */
var temperature = 0

// Answer Question 1 below


/*:
 
 ### Question 2
 
 `temperature` has been updated below to be -20.
 
 Write an if-else if statement that prints "Brr, grab your winter jacket!" if `temperature` is equal to 0, and temperature is anything less than 0, prints "Don't leave your water glass outside!".
 */
temperature = -20

// Answer Question 2 below


/*:
 
 ### Question 3
 
 `temperature` has been updated below to be 15 degrees.
 
 Write an if-else if-else statement that prints:
 
 * "Brr, grab your winter jacket!" if `temperature` is equal to 0
 * "Don't leave your water glass outside!" if `temperature` is anything less than 0
 * Otherwise, prints "It could be shorts weather but you might still be a bit chilly!"
 
 */
temperature = 15

// Answer Question 3 below

 ### Question 4
 
 Imagine that you are trying to write an app that identifies who an LCS teacher is based on a series of questions.
 
 The questions will be answered for you with either `true` or `false` and no other possible response.
 
 Three constants have been created below with certain values.
 
 Write an `if` statement that prints "Must be Gordon!" when the values of the constants would seem to suggest the person is Mr. Gordon, or otherwise prints "Hmm, need more data to be sure."

let hasRedHair = true
let alwaysGetsAttentionBySayingGentsAndLadies = true
let teachesOutdoorEd = true
