 # Use Source Control
 
 On all pages, you will be answering questions.
 
 Please, be sure to *commit and push your work after completing each page*.
 
 It wouldn't hurt to commit more frequently (after every question makes it easier to find links for your portfolio).
 
 The keyboard shortcut to start a commit is **Option-Command-C**.
