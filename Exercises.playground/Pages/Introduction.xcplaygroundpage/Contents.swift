 # Introduction
 
 The purpose of this playground is to check your knowledge of concepts from these sections of *App Development with Swift*:
 
 * 1.2: Constants, Variables, and Data Types
 * 1.3: Operators
 * 1.4: Control Flow
 
 You will receive feedback from Mr. Gordon, via GitHub, on your work in this playground after you commit it and add links to your Computer Science portfolio.
 
 In our very next class together, you will write another set of exercises like this that must go into your portfolio and are there to help you demonstrate your mastery of course expectations.
 
 Remember, the more documentation of learning that you have, the more you can expect and justify a top-level grade in this course.
 
 Also, and I hope more importantly, if you learn these fundamental concepts, you are well prepared to begin a project of your choosing in January â€“ be that an app, a game, or some other endeavour.
 
 Ready? Let's begin.
