 # Introduction
 
 The purpose of this playground is to check your knowledge of concepts from these sections of *App Development with Swift*:
 
 * 1.2: Constants, Variables, and Data Types
 * 1.3: Operators
 * 1.4: Control Flow
 
 You will receive feedback from Mr. Gordon, via GitHub, on your work in this playground after you commit it and add links to your Computer Science portfolio.
 
 The next step (after completing this playground) is to elect, in a class prior the Winter Break, to complete a similar playground (entirely in class) that will further demonstrate what you have learned.
 
 Ready? Let's begin.
