 # Introduction
 
 The purpose of this playground is to check your knowledge of concepts from these sections of *App Development with Swift*:
 
 * 1.2: Constants, Variables, and Data Types
 * 1.3: Operators
 
 You will receive feedback from Mr. Gordon, via GitHub, on your work in this playground after you commit it and add links to your Computer Science portfolio.
 
 In our very next class together on Thursday, you will write another set of exercises like this to check your knowledge of content from section 1.4 (Control Flow).
 
 After you add links to your portfolio from Thursday's class, you will also receive feedback on your work.
 
 Finally, on Saturday, you will write a third playground that again covers content from 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.
 
 This playground for Saturday's class serves as another layer of documentation of your learning for these key topics.
 
 Remember, the more documentation of learning that you have, the more you can expect and justify a top-level grade in this course.
 
 Also, and I hope more importantly, if you learn these fundamental concepts, you are well prepared to begin a project of your choosing in January â€“ be that an app, a game, or some other endeavour.
 
 Ready? Let's begin.
