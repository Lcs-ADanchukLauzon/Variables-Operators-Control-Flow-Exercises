 ### Question 2
 
 Create a constant called `myAge` of type `Int` and set it to your age. Use type inference to do this.
 
 Then create a constant called `otherAge` of type `Double` and set it to `40.0`. Use type inference to do this.
 
 Finally, create a constant called `averageAge` of type `Double` and set it to the average of `myAge` and `otherAge`.
